#Moore's Voting Algorithm is an efficient algorithm used 
#to find the majority element in an array.
#The majority element is defined as the element that appears more than âŒŠn/2âŒ‹ times, 
#where n is the length of the array. 
#The algorithm guarantees to find the majority element if it exists.

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:

        elif num == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
